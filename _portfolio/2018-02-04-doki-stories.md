	Inspired by popular visual novels like Doki Doki Literature Club and Steins;Gate, I made a story-based visual novel for the SLO Hacks 2018 hackathon. The game follows a day in the lives of a group of high school girls, and uses facial recognition to monitor the player's mood and adapt their gameplay accordingly.

  This project was conceived, designed, and created by a multi-disciplinary team of five Cal Poly students over the course of 24 hours. Best Google Cloud Platform Project Prize Winner.
