	I made a 2D sci-fi platformer game as a final project for my Game Design course. The game follows a retired cop that gets sucked back to the past and must find a way to return home.

  This project was conceived, designed, and created by a team of four Cal Poly students over the course of 10 weeks.

  You can play the game <a href="../../timerift/index.html">here</a>.
