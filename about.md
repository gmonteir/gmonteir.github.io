I am a Computer Science student at [California Polytechnic State University](https://www.calpoly.edu/) in San Luis Obispo. This is the place where I would put the company that I'm currently interning at, but I'm still working on that one.

I'm currently doing a lot of work on a number of projects in and outside of class, namely for the [Cal Poly Amusement Park Engineers and Designers (CAPED)](https://www.facebook.com/SLOCAPED/). I'll chase any opportunity to get involved in the themed entertainment industry.

My main areas of interest are in Virtual Reality, Computer Graphics, and Real-time Rendering.
