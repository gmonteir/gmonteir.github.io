small"> 11 minute read </span> </div> <article class="post-content"> <p>Okay, maybe it is. But it seems like every position in tech nowadays is <em>Something</em> Engineer or <em>Something</em> Developer, so I figured I’d take a shot at rebranding my image. But is a <em>Themed Entertainment Developer</em> an actual thing? My curiousity got the better of me, so I decided to find out.</p> <h3 id="where-i-looked-for-answers">Where I Looked For Answers</h3> <p>Somewhat shockingly, Wikipedia does not have an article for “Theme Park Engineering”. You can search around and find <a href="https://onlinemasters.ohio.edu/blog/amusement-park-and-roller-coaster-engineering/">various</a> <a href="https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/tpeg">theme</a> <a href="https://www.tpegosu.com/">park</a> <a href="http://www.psuthemeparkengineering.com/">engineering</a> <a href="https://cornelltpeg.weebly.com/">groups</a>, but still no article. There’s articles for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_management">“Engineering Management”</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering">“Industrial Engineering”</a> but looking at these, they don’t really map so well to what we’re talking about.</p> <p>I found <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-data-engineer/answer/Sean-McClure-3?srid=udLGL">this great answer from Sean McClure</a> to the question “How do I become a data engineer?” on <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>. It is broad and contains enough detail to set you off on the trail of further research. I’m going to use it as a base for my answer, fleshing out that parts that need further information on. On Quora there is also the <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-data-engineering">“What is data engineering?”</a> question, but I thought the answers found there were less clear.</p> <p>Here We Go.</p> <h3 id="what-is-a-data-engineer">What Is A Data Engineer?</h3> <blockquote> <p>Make sure you understand that Data Scientist and Data Engineer are not the same thing.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>A Data Scientist builds models using mathematics, statistics and machine learning to explain and predict complex behaviour, and codifies those models into real-world software. A Data Engineer <strong>designs and builds data architectures</strong> for <strong>ingestion</strong>, <strong>processing</strong>, and <strong>surfacing</strong> data for large-scale data-intensive applications.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ok so <strong>data architecture</strong>. This is an encompassing term concerned with all processess, methodologies, policies, and standards that set out how data exists and changes in systems. Data can be ‘at rest’ or ‘in motion’ and an architecture manages each state of data.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>(https://www.techopedia.com/definition/6730/data-architecture) These two states are high-level and don’t describe anything in detail, but the subject to even too big for a subject on its own.</p> <p><strong>Data Ingestion</strong> is a lot simpler a concept. By ‘ingesting’ data you are accessing data and processing it for immediate use or for storage and later use.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> It is the beginning of a data pipeline, as the data meets and is integrated with the data system.</p> <p><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html">Amazon Kinesis</a>, <a href="http://sqoop.apache.org/">Apache Sqoop</a>, and <a href="https://flume.apache.org/">Apache Flume</a> are some frameworks/tools for data ingestion. <em>Kafka</em> is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system. <em>Kinesis</em> is designed for collection and processing of data record streams. <em>Sqoop</em> is designed to transfer bulk data between Hadoop and RDBMSs. <em>Flume</em> is a distributed sysem for collecting log data. Researching these tools will reveal much more about data ingestion as an engineering challenge.</p> <p><strong>Data Processing</strong> is about collecting together of items of data and manipulating that collection to produce <em>meaningful information</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing#Data_processing_functions">Wikipedia provides a nice section on 7 ‘Data Processing Functions’</a>: Validation, Sorting, Summarisation, Aggregation, Analysis, Reporting, Classification. Understanding those seven function together gives you a good idea of what data processing is all about. <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a> is probably the biggest big data processing tool around today.</p> <p><strong>Data Surfacing</strong> is a term that I hadn’t heard before, and it’s not particularly prevalent on the web. Palantir’s <a href="https://www.palantir.com/what-we-believe/">“What We Believe”</a> page provides perhaps the best description of data <em>surfacing</em> by contrasting it with data <em>mining</em>. They say that data surfacing is about bringing up the “totality of known data about a problem in a way that’s easily digestible by the best pattern matching and inference machinery”.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> They say that it is characteristics about the data problem that directs an engineer towards <em>mining</em> or <em>surfacing</em>, so it may be that some data engineers don’t end up doing a lot of the latter.</p> <blockquote> <p>Often the Data Scientist and Data Engineer will work together to build an <strong>end-to-end solution</strong> for companies requiring advanced analytical models that are <strong>operationalized</strong> at scale. The Data Scientist is interested in large scale architecture only insomuch as it allows the “science to scale.” Thus <strong>any Big Data project should have a Data Scientist alongside the Data Engineer to ensure that what gets built is <em>analytically sound</em></strong> (no point in engineering a big data architecture that doesn’t prepare and process data in a way that supports the specific models built by the Scientist).</p> </blockquote> <p>In this context, an <strong>end-to-end solution</strong> is one where the requirement’s of the client/user are fulfilled entirely by a system. What is built fulfils the ‘data in’ to ‘information out’ steps and everything in between.</p> <p>My favourite description of <strong>operationalization</strong> was from <a href="https://thinkbiganalytics.com/understanding-the-difference-between-operational-and-operationalized-analytics/">Think Big Analytics</a>. operationalization is the focus on taking data science insights and analytics and incorporating them into business units in order to take action in production environment.</p> <p>The last bolded part of the above paragraph I included because this echoed my experiences of my application to Zendesk’s data engineering team. Through my application I was interviewed by almost all the DE team and by around 4/9 in the Data Science team. It was made clear that there was a close working relationship between the two teams.</p> <blockquote> <p>As with the Data Scientist there is <strong>no formal path to becoming a Data Engineer</strong> since it is a unique blend of skills that have been brought together to form a distinct and much needed discipline. The requirements for a Data Scientist are typically more “academic” as they are expected to understand and conduct scientific research and know how to build and test advanced models. PhDs are often sought for Data Science, with backgrounds in the hard sciences or computer science. Data Engineers typically come from an engineering background with less emphasis on the academic background, although many still have Masters degrees. Often developers interested in designing large scale architectures for data-intensive applications can move towards this field as there is much less emphasis on science and math and more on engineering and development.</p> </blockquote> <p>This part of the answer was concerned more with academic requirements. It does appear to me that there is no “formal path” to a position in DE, and I certainly wasn’t aware of it going into computer science and software engineering at university. I got a sense that there must be a good deal of work involved in what I thought of as the ‘back-end’ of machine learning, data science, and AI. There in fact is, and more and more companies are beginning to grow their DE teams because they contribute to the strength of a company’s machine intelligence.</p> <blockquote> <p>Since there is <strong>less emphasis on advanced academic background</strong> it can be easier for someone to move into the Data Engineering field compared to Data Science.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is an encouraging thing, particularly for someone that is interested in data but is daunted by the prospect of spending 5 years in a PHD after 3-4 years in undergraduate studies. Easier to move into doesn’t mean easy though. Reddit user <code class="highlighter-rouge">u/Astra108</code> talks breifly about the difficulty of DE in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/5bkf63/why_is_san_francisco_on_a_data_engineering_hiring/d9p7rqr/">this comment</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Data Engineers should understand the <strong>core concepts in computer science</strong> and should be very <strong>well versed in building and designing large scale applications; end-to-end.</strong> They should understand the <strong>pros and cons of using relational and noSQL databases.</strong> They must know how to <strong>design effective pipelines for both batch and streaming use cases.</strong> They must know what it takes to <strong>operationalize a working model</strong> and <strong>how to help push some of the “lab” specifics (training and validation) into real-time engines.</strong> They must <strong>understand distributed computing</strong> and should be able to work with the Data Scientist to <strong>help split algorithms effectively</strong> to still yield predictive accuracy across a variety of domains. They should know when to push schemas towards the application to allow for <strong>“data lake” designs</strong> that assist in large scale analysis but still serve domain-specific applications. And they <strong>should be very familiar with the core technologies</strong> that are used to build these systems.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <strong>‘core concepts’</strong> of computer science should be familiar to anybody seeking success in computer science or software engineering. <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-important-fundamental-concepts-in-Computer-Science">This Quora question</a> has answers that list them well I think.</p> <p>I think the second bolded text string, about being “well versed…”, is something that can’t really be taught or learnt well outside of industry. Large scale applications can’t be engaged with in the classroom or at home. A good internship or a job will be invaluable in this area.</p> <p>Relational (SQL) vs NoSQL Databasing is a big topic, but I think <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31968494">Ravindra babu’s stackoverflow introductory answer</a> is a good place to start. I myself have some research to do in this area.</p> <p>Here we see the first mention of the <strong>pipeline</strong>. They are a computing element consisting of a set of <em>data processing elements</em> connected one after the other, meaning the output of a previous element becomes the input to another. Think human-centipede style. If you want to look at an open-source pipline check out <a href="https://github.com/fluxcapacitor/pipeline">fluxcapacitor/pipeline</a>.</p> <p><strong>Distributed Computing</strong> is a model of computing whereby networked computers work together by passing data/information/messages along network communication paths. An understanding of distributed computing is absolutely essential for DE as any sufficiently large engineering problem will require distributed vs. monolithic systems.</p> <p><strong>Splitting algorithms</strong> is another thing that I hadn’t heard of, and unfortunately nothing I could find online made sense of the term.</p> <p>With <strong>‘data lake’ design</strong> we’re back to well documented terms. The coiner of the term (James Dixon) forwards an illuminating contrast of ‘data mart’ and ‘data lake’. The data mart is a convienience store filled with <em>bottled</em> water. The water (data) is cleansed and packaged and structured for easy consumption, but you can only consume in one way. The data lake is a large body of water, with the resource in its more <em>natural</em> state. The data lake is there for various users with various needs to examine and collect whatever they need, because everything is there.</p> <p>The last thing in this paragraph are the <strong>core technologies</strong>. The following could be considered a solid list on what they would be. To the data enthusiast many would be familiar.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*V9XtbEVaT_Ty1wEjykLcPg.png" alt="big data core tech" /></p> <p>The really important ones would be:</p> <ul> <li>Apache Kafka</li> <li>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</li> <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3</li> <li>Apache Spark (Streaming and Batch modes)</li> <li>Apache Pig</li> <li>Apache Cassandra</li> <li>ElasticSearch</li> <li>Tableau (visualisation)</li> <li>Apache ‘Yet Another Resource Negotiator’ (YARN)</li> <li>Luigi (scheduling/monitoring)</li> <li>Airflow (scheduling/monitoring)</li> <li>SQL</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>The only way to become great at what you do is to constantly and relentlessly jump into problems and solve them using the techniques and approaches of your choice field. There are <strong>many books and tutorials on the technology used by the Data Engineer.</strong> <strong>Choose a problem and a public dataset and build a system. Build many systems.</strong> Fail again and again and learn what it takes to bring an end-to-end solution to a real-world problem. Anyone can take a course or read a book. But if you have real projects you have built and worked on you can point to these and discuss in-depth the challenges you faced and how you solved them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, yes, you still need to read books in 2016.

All these terms are worth a Google as there are whole practices built around them. On the ground, daily work consists of:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <ul> <li>managing <strong>data stewardship</strong> within the organisation</li> <li>managing and <strong>maintaining data source systems</strong> and <strong>staging areas</strong></li> <li>performing <strong>ETL</strong> and <strong>data conversion</strong></li> <li>facilitating <strong>data cleansing and enrichment</strong> through <strong>data de-duplication and construction</strong></li> <li>performing ad-hoc <strong>data extraction</strong></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>This short answer introduces <em>yet more</em> terms for us to understand.
