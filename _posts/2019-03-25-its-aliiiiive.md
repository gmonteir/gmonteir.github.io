I'm going to preface this by saying that I have never had a blog before. This is the third iteration of my website, and I never once considered including a blog. And why is that? Who knows? Maybe my introverted selfconscious was keeping me from sharing my feelings with the world. Maybe my capacity for other social mediums was already filled. I think part of me failed to see the point in speaking my mind when I never seem to have an audience. I mean, I already do that on Facebook anyway. Why is this any different?

Well for starters, I'm actually starting to find it quite soothing to just put down words without the pressure of an audience, therapeutic even. Kind of like a digital journal, if you will. Maybe I'll start doing this more often. Or maybe my stress-ridden, distracted brain will forget about this by tomorrow. I never know.

Anyways, welcome to my website. It's pretty minimalist, sure. But it gets the job done, and that's what matters in the end, right? Feel free to check out some of my work in the portfolio section. If you have any questions for me, please use the contact page.
